MUA/XML2 Limit Adjuster
==============================

**Original work: https://github.com/ThirteenAG/III.VC.SA.LimitAdjuster**

This is a open source limit adjuster for Marvel Ultimate Alliance and X-Men Legends 2 aiming to bring back limit adjusters to the scene.

However it does not aim to be just a limit ***adjuster***, but a limit ***purger***, that's, turning whatever previously was limited into unlimited, being only limited by the machine/application capacity.

### Goals
 * Bring limit adjusters back to the scene, but not totally centralized into one person
 * Avoid little limit adjusters here and there
 * Be an extremely stable limit adjuster
 * Purge out limits from the face of the community, we are in a dynamic world!

### Compiling

The source code targets pre-C++11 compilers with naked attribute, that is [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads) 2010 or greater.

Then run premake5 (executable included) from the base directory to generate the projects file in the *build/* directory specifying the compiler you're using.
By using command line, this can be done by the following command for Visual Studio 2010:

    premake5 vs2010

That's it, you have a Visual Studio 2010 solution now, you are ready to contribute and compile.
To generate solution for another Visual Studio version just change the *2010* to the version you are using _(e.g. vs2013)_.
